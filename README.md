This project is basically to find a murderer and the villain who sponsored murder.
# Introduction
The project captures a crime that has taken place and the police department needs help to do its work with findings from the gathered result files. The detective handed over the crime scene report, which somehow was lost. But Vaguely remembers that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018,​ and that it took place in ​SQL City. To help out I wrote this query to find the murderer and the villain behind the killing.

# The documentation
Includes gathering the data by downloading the dataset from SQL city, creating a database, importing the dataset in Postgres SQL, querying it, and finding the murderer and villain.
